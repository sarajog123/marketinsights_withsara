<p>EDI stands for Electro Deionization Ultrapure Water System. The Electro Deionization process uses ion exchange resins, ion-selective membranes, and an applied DC electrical current to remove ions, such as salts, acids, and bases. Weakly ionized materials, like dissolved silica, carbon dioxide, boron, and some organics, are also removed. EDI modules are built with membranes permeable to either cations or anions in an alternating sequence. The spaces between them act as liquid flow compartments, each with an inlet and an outlet. Dependent on the polarity of the ion exchange membrane and its orientation to a cathode or anode, an individual compartment depletes the water of ions (product water) or accumulates ions (reject water).</p>
<p>&nbsp;The dilute and concentrate compartments are filled with ion exchange resins to transfer in low ionic strength solutions. In this EDI module, approximately 5% of the volume of feed flow continuously washes out the ions from the concentrate compartments. This concentrate outlet, the reject stream, is recirculated upstream of the RO system to be recovered, while the dilute compartments deliver purified product water. Unlike traditional Ion Exchange resin systems, EDI needs no chemical regeneration. All EDI devices producing ultrapure water operate in electro-regeneration mode, in which the resins are continuously regenerated by H+ and OH- ions released by the electrically-induced dissociation of water molecules.</p>
<p>Technological advancements in EDI systems are helping in improved efficiency and enhanced performance. They have advanced monitoring and control capabilities, improved resin design, and innovative electrode configurations, which allow efficient water treatment processes.</p>
<p>Industries such as Pharmaceuticals, Electronics, and Manufacturing mostly need EDI systems as they must follow strict water quality standards and regulations.</p>
<p>Key areas of focus include sectors leveraging the products or services, leading market participants, and evolving consumer preferences. The report provides a detailed examination of competitive landscapes, regulatory influences, and technological advancements shaping the market.</p>
